Time Complexity Analysis of Array Methods:

.push():
    Time complexity: O(1)
    Space complexity: O(1)
    Push adds the item to the end of the array,
    and once this happens there are no subsequent calls to make.

.pop():
    Time: O(1)
    Space: O(1)
    Like push, except pop removes the item from the end
    without needing to move or reference other elements

.shift():
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1)
    shift removes the first item from the array,
    but has to move every element up one to fill new space.

.unshift():
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(n)
    unshift adds an item to the beginning of the array,
    but also has to shift existing elements by one
